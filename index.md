<p><b>7. Keep communal areas free from obstruction.</b><br>
These areas must be kept free from obstruction at all times so that in the event of a Fire, the common stairwells, hallways etc are free from any obstruction likely to delay exit or the Emergency Services gaining access.</p>

<p><b>8. The end of the tenancy.</b><br>
All rubbish (and anything you have brought in) should be removed. All bins should be left clean and empty.<br>Plan ahead so that council bins are empty when the house is vacated.</p>

Please keep the outside areas clean and tidy, and the grass short.</p>
