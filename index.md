<h2>FAQ</h2>

<p><b>1. How can I set the heating?</b><br>
The heating is set by the control at the top of the stairs. You can set the day/night temp as required - instructions can be found inside the flap of the controller.</p>
<p>Leave the heating on low when on holiday to avoid frozen pipes, especially in the winter months.</p>

It marks the surfaces.</p>

<p><b>5. Please do not hang laundry to dry inside your room.</b><br>
You can hang your washing outside or in the upstairs toilet with the window open, (make sure to avoid condensation which will result in mould growth).</p>

<p><b>7. Keep mattress covers on the mattress.</b><br>
On the day you move in you will find there are two covers on your mattress.<br> The top one is a dust cover which can be removed before using. The second cover is a new/cleaned (disinfected) waterproof mattress cover to help protect the mattress.<br> Please make sure that these waterproof covers are kept on the mattress for the whole time you live here, and are left on the mattress when you leave at the end of the year. These cost £40-50 to replace.<br>

<p><b>8. Keep communal areas free from obstruction.</b><br>
These areas must be kept free from obstruction at all times so that in the event of a Fire, the common stairwells, hallways etc are free from any obstruction likely to delay exit or the Emergency Services gaining access.</p>

<p><b>9. The end of the tenancy.</b><br>
All rubbish (and anything you have brought in) should be removed. All bins should be left clean and empty.<br>Plan ahead so that council bins are empty when the house is vacated.</p>

<p><b>10. Keep the outside area tidy.</b><br>
Please keep the outside areas clean and tidy, and the grass short. It is easier to keep the grass short than trying to cut after it's overgrown.</p>

<p><b>11. Safety</b><br>
Make sure appliances are turned off when leaving or going out for the day.</p>

<p><b>Enjoy and Good Luck with your studies.</b></p>
